    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the cost of goods manufactured<br> 
    What is the cost of goods manufactured?<br>
    The cost of goods manufactured (COGM) is a schedule that tells the total production costs of a company in a specific time period.<br>
    How to calculate cost of goods manufactured?<br>
    To calculate cost of goods manufactured you should use the following formula:<br>
    cost of goods manufactured = beginning work in process inventory + total manufacturing cost - ending work in process inventory<br>
    Example: Company x start ht eyear with $17,000, during the year the factory spends $40,000 on direct materials and $15,000 on manufacturing overhead, in the end of the year the company has $20,000 in ending work in process inventory, what it the cost of goods manufactured?<br>
    First we should calculate the total manufacturing cost:<br>
    total manufacturing cost = direct materials + manufacturing overhead<br>
    total manufacturing cost = $40,000 + $15,000<br>
    total manufacturing cost = $55,000<br>
    Now let's calculate the cost of goods manufactured:<br>
    cost of goods manufactured = beginning work in process inventory + total manufacturing cost - ending work in process inventory<br>
    cost of goods manufactured = $17,000 + $55,000 - $20,000<br>
    cost of goods manufactured = $52,000<br>
    Why use cost of goods manufactured?<br>
    The cost of goods shold is usually used by management to get an idea of the overall production costs in order to decide if these costs are high or low.<br>
